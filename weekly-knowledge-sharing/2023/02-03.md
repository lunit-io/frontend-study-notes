Functional proposals and the progress of the 94th TC39 meeting can be found.

Interesting suggestions

- [Change Array by Copy(stage4)](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-change-array-by-copy): Provides additional methods on Array.prototype and TypedArray.prototype to enable changes on the array by returning a new copy of it with the change.
- [Async Context(stage1)](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-async-context): proposal is to provide a mechanism to ergonomically track async contexts in JavaScript.

## [VS Code v1.75](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_75)

- [Profiles](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_75#_profiles): Create and share profiles to configure extensions, settings, shortcuts, and more. It would be useful to set up a profile according to the development language.
- [Easier multi-view resizing](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_75#_workbench): Drag layout corners to resize multiple views at once.
- [Code Action list is now scrollable](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_75#_code-action-list-is-now-scrollable): Some extensions generate long lists of Code Actions. If there is not space to render all Code Actions, you can now scroll through the list

Jumpy provides fast cursor movement, inspired by Atom's package of the same name.

## [perplexity](https://www.perplexity.ai)

It is similar to the chatGPT, but gives you a source.

## [Raycast](https://www.raycast.com/)

This is similar to [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/).
It lets you complete tasks, calculate, share common links, and much more.
