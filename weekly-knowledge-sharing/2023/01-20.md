### Today we learned

1. The difference between npm, yarn, yarn berry, and pnpm

2. Interesting site and library

    - [DoneNote](https://donenote.com/?ref=producthunt)
    - [React Datepicker](https://reactdatepicker.com/)
      ```jsx
      import React, { useState } from "react";
      import DatePicker from "react-datepicker";

      import "react-datepicker/dist/react-datepicker.css";

      // CSS Modules, react-datepicker-cssmodules.css
      // import 'react-datepicker/dist/react-datepicker-cssmodules.css';

      const Example = () => {
        const [startDate, setStartDate] = useState(new Date());
        return (
          <DatePicker selected={startDate} onChange={(date) => setStartDate(date)} />
        );
      };
      ```

      When using this library, you need the CSS file for this package (or provide your own). if you need the custom style, This library will be useful.

3. Github actions & npm

    - npm v8.0.0 is one of the pre-installed packages in the ubuntu container of github actions
    - If you don't want to slow down the CI build process by installing non-installed packages like npm v9.0.0, check the runner-images and consider using pre-installed packages.
