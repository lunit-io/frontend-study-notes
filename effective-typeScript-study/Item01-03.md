# Items 1-3

# Item 1: Understand the Relationship Between TypeScript and JavaScript

- "TypeScript is a (typed) superset of JavaScript." → TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript in a syntactic sense
- This means that so long as your JS program doesn't have any syntax erorrs, then it is also a TS program
- A valid .js file doesn't need any additional change to be converted to a .ts file. → very helpful when migrating
- TypeScript can infer types of variables from the initial value (type inference)
- Type annotations tells TypeScript what your intent is with your code and lets it do a better job at catching errors that might happen at runtime
- TypeScript's type system models the runtime behavior of JavaScript but doesn't perfectly match it
    - Statements that are deemed valid
    
    ```tsx
    const x = 2 + '3';
    const y = '2' + 3;
    ```
    
    - Statements that are deemed invalid
    
    ```tsx
    const a = null + 7;
    const b = [] + 12;
    ```
    
- How far TypeScript goes to model JavaScript's runtime behavior depends on the judgement of the team that builds it

# Item 2: Know Which TypeScript Options You're Using

- The most important settings: `noImplicitAny`, `strictNullChecks`
- With `noImplicitAny` turned on, the following code generates errors

```tsx
function add(a, b) {
	return a + b;
}
```

- Turn `noImplicitAny` on whenever possible
- `strictNullChecks` controls whether `null` or `undefined` are permissible values in every type

```tsx
const x: number = null // OK, if strictNullChecks is off
const x: number | null = null // fixed for strictNullChecks on
```

- Should probably enable `noImplicitAny` before `strictNullChecks`
- Use `strict` setting to get the most thorough checking TS can offer
- In any case, always be aware of options you're using

# Item 3: Understand that Code Generation is Independent of Types

- `tsc` (TypeScript compiler) does two things:
    - converts TypeScript code to an older version of JavaScript that runs on browsers - transpiling
    - checks your code for type errors
- However, these two behaviors are completely independent of one another, which results in following behaviors:
    - Code with type errors can produce output
    - You cannot check TS types at runtime
    
    ```tsx
    interface Square {
    	width: number
    }
    interface Rectangle extends Square {
    	height: number
    }
    type Shape = Square | Rectangle
    
    function calculateArea(shape: Shape) {
    	if (shape instanceof Rectangle) {  // this does not work!!
    		return shape.width * shape.height;
    	}
    	return shape.width * shape.width
    }
    // Possible alternatives
    // 1. check for 'height' property
    if ('height' in shape)
    // 2. add a "tag" to each type
    interface Square {
    	kind: 'square'
    	width: number
    }
    interface Rectangle {
    	kind: 'rectangle'
    	width: number
    	height: number
    }
    // 3. use "class" keyword to generate both type and value
    class Square { ... }
    class Rectangle { ... }
    ...
    if (shape instanceof Rectangle)
    ```
    
    - Type operations cannot affect runtime values
    
    ```tsx
    // this does nothing because "as" is a type operation
    function asNumber(val: number | string): number {
    	return val as number
    }
    // whereas this should work as inteded
    function asNumber(val: number | string): number {
    	return typeof(val) === 'string' ? Number(val) : val
    }
    ```
    
    - Runtime types may not be the same as declared types (most commonly on a value from an API request)
    - You cannot overload a function based on TypeScript types.
    
    ```tsx
    // This does not work
    function add(a: number, b: number): number { return a + b }
    function add(a: string, b: string): string { return a + b }
    // This works only at the type level
    function add(a: number, b: number): number;
    function add(a: string, b: string): string;
    function add(a, b) { return a + b }
    ```
    
    - TypeScript types has (almost) no effect on runtime performance
        - TS may introduce performance overhead when transpiled to an older target that does not have native support for some newer language features, and they're used in the codebase
